# Design and Development of Variable Stiffness Tapered Type Soft Robotic Gripper for Fruit Picking Applications

### This repository contains all the details of the Project.

Soft robotics is a field of robotics that deals with the design, control, and fabrication of robots using compliant materials instead of rigid links. This project dealt with the limitations of fruit picking. Previously, fruit handling relied on manual labour and rigid grippers. To counter problems faced by prior methods, a PneuNet Variable Stiffness Tapered Type Soft Robotic Gripper was developed.

A variable stiffness gripper allowed the gripper to conform to the various fruit shapes and sizes. The tapered shape enables precise handling of fruits. The actuation of the gripper is done by a pneumatic system with variable pressures. 

The development process included design, analysis, simulation, fabrication, and integration. The design was done using Fusion 360, and the FE Analysis and Parametric Analysis were done using Ansys. Tensile tests were conducted using the EZ-SX Texture Analyzer, a Universal Testing Machine (UTM) designed particularly for material testing. LSR2, a hyperelastic material, was utilized to fabricate the gripper, allowing for variable stiffness. 3D printing and moulding were employed in the fabrication of the gripper. The gripper was integrated with the UR5 COBOT robotic arm for precise fruit picking.
